The submittal zipped file “sxc2321.zip” contains the following:

1. This writeup: “SXC2321-WRITEUP-LAB2.txt”
2. Java file: “Bully.java”

Please note: Prior to compiling, I have installed jdk1.8.0_141 and jre1.8.0_141

THE WRITEUP

Instruction:
1. How to compile:
In MS windows, using command prompt, and getting into folder where "Bully.java" is stored. Then, type: "C:\Program Files\java\jdk1.8.0_141\bin\javac" Bully.java.
Once classes file are created, type: java Bully. The first process window should pop up. Then repeat to open another 4 windows by using the same command: java Bully.

2. Run the program
Now, the 5 windows should be opened. To start the program, click on "Start Election" button on any process per Bully algorithm. Then, observe the message being displayed.
The highest process should declare itself as the Coordinator, and broadcast a live message to all other processes. Each process will pick up a random time delay. 
To shutdown the Coordinator process, click on "Crash" button. At this point, process(es) that know the coordinator not responding should initiate the Election. 
At last each process will find the new Coordinator and this new Coodinator will broadcast live message. 
To bring back up the crashed process, click on "Resume" button. Once it is resumed, it should start the election process again. 
Note: "Clear" button can be used to clear the logs message.
